# TCP-Segment-Visualizer
TCP Segment Visualizer is a Python-based tool that enables users to upload Wireshark capture files (`.pcap`/`.pcapng`) and analyze TCP segments. It extracts key metrics such as Round-Trip Time (RTT), Timeout Intervals, Congestion Window (CWND), and Receiver Window (RWND) values, and presents them in dynamic graphs and a detailed TCP header table.
